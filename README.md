## Quick Start

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Syzygianinfern0/arch-linux-magic/main/arch_install.sh | bash
```

## What?

This repo is basically a (yet-to-be) collection of a good deal random stuff. This might as well be replaced by a bunch
of forked repos, but I'm too lazy to manage each of them as individual projects. The source for each file/folder can be
found at their top. 

## TODO

- [ ] Get a working script
- [ ] Fix dotfiles repo
- [ ] Customize dwm
- [ ] Customize dwm blocks
- [ ] Customize st
- [ ] Customize dmenu
