# Arch Linux Magic

## Quick Start

Setup your disk partitions when the `cfdisk /dev/<name-of-partition>` comes and create an EFI and a Root partition. Make
sure you remember their names cause the installer script will prompt you for it!

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Syzygianinfern0/arch-linux-magic/main/arch_install.sh
bash ./arch_install.sh
```

## What?

This repo is basically a (yet-to-be) collection of a good deal random stuff. This might as well be replaced by a bunch
of forked repos, but I'm too lazy to manage each of them as individual projects. The source for each file/folder can be
found at their top.

## TODO

- [ ] Get a working script
- [ ] Fix dotfiles repo
- [ ] Customize dwm
- [ ] Customize dwm blocks
